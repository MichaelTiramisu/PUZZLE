There has been a conversation with at least one investment bank.\nMoreover, one woman who works at the Weinstein Company described an operation in chaos on Friday, with phones going unanswered and some staff members in revolt. Nicole Quenqua, formerly the company’s top spokeswoman, said she was no longer giving company statements to reporters.\nOver the past week, the Weinstein Company has been at the center of a widening crisis involving Mr. Weinstein’s brother, Harvey. Investigations by The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed sexual harassment and rape allegations against Harvey Weinstein going back decades.\nHarvey Weinstein, who has denied “any allegations of non-consensual sex,” was fired on Sunday by Weinstein Company board members, which include his brother. Several other members of the all-male board have quit, including Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor; Marc Lasry, owner of the Milwaukee Bucks and chief executive of Avenue Capital Group, an investment firm; Tim Sarnoff, president of production services and deputy chief executive of Technicolor; and Richard Koenigsberg, an accountant, who resigned on Thursday.\nThe Weinstein Company, with roughly 150 staff members in New York and Los Angeles, has assets that are potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It includes a television unit anchored by series like “Project Runway.” A theatrical division has seven completed films, including “The Current War,” a period drama about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse starring Benedict Cumberbatch, who said in a statement on Tuesday that he was “utterly disgusted” by Mr. Weinstein’s “horrifying and unforgivable actions.”\nAs Hollywood has distanced itself from the company — Apple ended plans for a series produced by the Weinstein Company, for instance, and other network partners have considered similar action — questions have mounted about whether the studio can continue. On Thursday, bankruptcy speculation surfaced in Variety. On Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Weinstein Company was “exploring a sale or shutdown.”\nIn his statement on Friday about business as usual, Bob Weinstein cited upcoming releases from the studio’s Dimension label, which focuses on family and horror movies. They include “Polaroid,” a horror movie scheduled for release in theaters on Nov. 22, and a children’s film, “Paddington 2,” which is set for Jan. 12 release.

INSERT INTO `news` VALUES (5, 2, 'Why Surge Prices Make Us So Mad: What Springsteen, Home Depot, and a Nobel Winner Know', 'Neil Irwin', 1507870800, 'When Bruce Springsteen decided to do a run of shows at a Broadway theater with fewer than a thousand seats, he appeared to reject the laws of economics — or at least what would seem to be in his financial best interest.\nHe limited ticket prices to between $75 and $850 and has been allocating them through a lottery that includes identity verification. His goal was to prevent scalping. Yet not everyone who sought tickets got them at those prices. The tickets that have leaked onto the open market on StubHub ranged in one recent search from $1,200 to $9,999.\nIt sure looks as if Mr. Springsteen left a great deal of money on the table and impeded the laws of the marketplace. After all, some people got tickets for $75 for which others were willing to pay four figures.\nBut the strategy may be less irrational than the raw numbers suggest. And understanding the hidden logic behind concert pricing — or how Home Depot responds to a hurricane, or even how your neighborhood restaurant handles the Valentine’s Day crunch — can provide a guide to solving some of society’s biggest problems while satisfying people’s deep need for a sense of fairness.\nUnderstanding this logic can also win you a Nobel in economics. At least, it did recently for the University of Chicago economist Richard H. Thaler, who was honored for work that includes study of what constitutes fairness in markets. He has shown that the simplistic Economics 101 version of how markets work — in which a seller raises prices however much it takes to match demand — can be inefficient, or offend people’s moral sensibilities, or both.\nTechnology is making “variable” or “dynamic” pricing — the same strategies that ensure a seat on an airplane, a hotel room or an Uber car are almost always available if you’re willing to pay the price — more plausible in areas with huge social consequences.\nDynamic pricing of electricity could help bring down pollution, reduce energy costs and make renewable energy more viable. Constantly adjusting prices for access to highways and congested downtowns could make traffic jams, with all the resulting wasted time and excess emissions, a thing of the past. Any sector where supplies tend to be fixed but demand fluctuates — the water supply, health care — would seem like prime candidates for variable pricing.\nBut technologists, entrepreneurs and regulators who would go down this path first need to learn a few lessons from Mr. Thaler — and Mr. Springsteen.\n“A good rule of thumb is we shouldn’t impose a set of rules that will create moral outrage, even if that moral outrage seems stupid to economists,” Mr. Thaler said.\nAs it turns out, when you look at when and how dynamic pricing provokes outrage, you detect some patterns — and a guidebook on getting some of the benefits of economic efficiency without fueling outrage that dooms the entire project.\nMusicians taking the long view\nThe underpricing of popular concert tickets is nothing new. In an earlier era, this was visible in long lines of fans camping out to buy them. Now, the gap between fans’ willingness to pay and the official price drives online ticket marketplaces, and a constant cat-and-mouse game pitting concert promoters against ticket brokers. And Mr. Springsteen’s show is grappling with the same challenge that “Hamilton,” and other hot tickets on Broadway have faced: limited seating, seemingly limitless demand.\nResearch by the economists Marie Connolly of the University of Quebec and Alan Krueger of Princeton based on a sample of major concerts in 2006 estimated that artists and promoters left about 5 percent of potential income (or around $200 million) on the table by underpricing tickets relative to the market rate.\nSome in the music business see this as the height of irrationality. “Most concert tickets are not priced to market,” said Marc Geiger, a leading agent to musicians with WME Entertainment. He described showing an artist that the front-row concert tickets, priced flat at $125, were selling for $900 to $1,300 on the secondary market.\n“I say, please, let me take some of those and price them at market,” Mr. Geiger said at the Music Industry Research Association conference in August in Los Angeles. Confoundingly, he said, the same artist might chafe at discounting the back rows of an arena to ensure a sellout, for fear of appearing to give away tickets too cheaply.\n“We are still coming out of the era of rock ’n’ roll socialism,” he said. “I think the concert industry is still in a bit of head-in-the-sand economics.”\nBut given that the apparent underpricing has been so widespread and so persistent, is it possible the strategy is more rational than it seems? That’s what Ms. Connolly and Mr. Krueger argue. For artists, no one show exists in a vacuum. And the things that might maximize revenue for any given night might not be the elements that matter in the longer term in developing devoted fans.\nThere’s the issue of fairness, of course. Fans don’t want to think their favorite artist is gouging. And the entire concert experience may be better if raucous superfans are in the front rows, rather than whoever is able to pay four figures for a ticket. The goal is to create an experience that makes everyone leave with a warm glow, their fandom of that artist that much deeper.\nIf artists did raise prices sharply, there’s a risk they would need to discount prices later to fill up the arena. Research shows that when people find out they overpaid for something, they buy less in the future.\nSo one view of the Springsteen approach is that it is economically irrational. But another is that it is part of a long-term relationship between a performer and his fans.\nThat might be a lesson for the other industries where variable pricing could make a lot of sense.\nFairness helps people keep cool\nThose scorching days of midsummer, when every air-conditioner in a hundred-mile radius is cranking at full blast, are hard on utilities.\nMost of the time, they can meet electricity demand with modern, efficient natural gas power plants that keep power flowing consistently at reasonable cost and with moderate carbon emissions, combined with nuclear and renewable energy plants that are pretty much always operating.\nBut on brutally hot days (and perhaps a few bitter cold days in the winter, too), things get trickier. To keep up with demand, utilities have to turn to old, expensive, dirty coal and oil plants. Some power plants maintain a crew year-round in order to be able to generate electricity only a few days during peak demand.\nAs a result, the cost of energy production can be four or five times as high on a high-demand day as on a low-demand day.\nYet the way most Americans buy electricity, that is all invisible. Utilities typically charge a single price per kilowatt-hour of electricity no matter when it was used.\nIf the price of electricity varied from hour to hour as airline tickets do, it might create incentives on high-demand days for consumers to set their air-conditioners a few degrees higher or to postpone running their washer and dryer till the overnight hours. The old, inefficient plants could be mothballed, and air pollution would decrease.\n\nIt sounds easy, an elegant use of markets to increase efficiency. And in some limited-scale experiments, it’s already happening. In Illinois Elevate Energy says that it has saved 28,000 customers 15 percent on their electricity with a system of variable electricity pricing through two utilities. In normal times, energy might cost 3 or 4 cents, while on peak days it can surge to 14 cents.\nBut the people working on such programs are also aware of some of the problems that could emerge if they aren’t careful. And they come back to some of the same notions of fairness that underpin the concert pricing conundrum.\nAffluent people could easily decide it’s just not worth the effort to adapt their energy consumption to the spot price, making the programs a penalty for the poor. And some people might have trouble followingconstantly changing prices or knowing how to trim their usage in response. Woe betide the utility executive facing customers who are angry upon suddenly receiving a $2,000 electricity bill after a heat wave.\n\nIt could get worse. If a poor older person turned off air-conditioning during a heat wave to avoid the price spike and died of heat stroke, it would be a human tragedy. People on supplemental oxygen can’t turn the machines off to save money.\n“I’m a big believer that you don’t just give people a raw price signal, but provide them with support and financing to invest in the infrastructure to respond appropriately,” said Daniel Esty, a Yale environmental law professor and former commissioner of Connecticut’s energy and environmental protection agency. “Even better over time would be a system where people don’t have to think about it, where smart appliances are connected to a smart grid that would enable them to do their part in a kind of invisible-hand sort of way.”\nThe Illinois program has included email and text alerts to tell people when surge pricing is in effect, and some customers are using technology involving smart thermostats so that their temperature setting adjusts automatically. “This doesn’t have to be something people need to monitor every day to be successful,” said Sarah Gulezian, senior manager of dynamic pricing programs at Elevate Energy.\nMoreover, it might prove possible to create pricing structures that guarantee consumers won’t pay more than they would have under traditional pricing, essentially seizing the benefits of dynamic pricing without anyone getting an unpleasant risk of sticker shock. That’s because most households see savings under the plans, and only a handful see their prices rise.\nUtilities and regulators, in other words, have to think a little like Mr. Springsteen: It’s not just about maximizing the efficiency of the energy market on any one day, just as the Boss isn’t trying to maximize his revenue from any one concert. Rather, it’s about maintaining a relationship in which people do not feel like they have been exploited.\nSome short-term inefficiency can buy long-term viability. And that’s never truer than when disaster strikes, whether a heat wave, a blizzard or a hurricane barreling toward the most populous area of Florida.\nHome Depot and a hurricane\nAs Hurricane Irma did just that in early September, about 150 Home Depot officials gathered in the company’s Atlanta headquarters in an auditorium and a series of conference rooms that became the company’s temporary command center. Logistics experts, store operations officials, corporate security staffers, human resources employees, lawyers and representatives of major suppliers were all there, in what is now a well-rehearsed exercise.\n\nThe first thing they did was direct all prices to be frozen in areas likely to be affected by the storm. There is no surge pricing at Home Depot stores after a disaster, in both a longstanding corporate policy and a matter of law in many states.\nBut the company doesn’t stop with that. All those logistics people and other staffers are there to ensure that the surge in demand after a disaster is matched with a higher supply of the goods people need.\nAs hurricane season approaches, dedicated warehouses are stocked with goods that will be needed if a major storm hits, according to the company’s director of corporate communications, Stephen Holmes. And that’s why, as soon as Irma passed the Miami area and the major highways were confirmed to be passable, a convoy of 41 tractor-trailers full of generators, plywood, chain saws and similar items trekked from Georgia to South Florida, escorted by the police.\nThe key is responding to a desperate situation not by raising prices, but also not by being content with shortages of badly needed goods. Rather, emergencies are an occasion to increase supply, even if it means incurring big logistical costs to do so.\nThat could have a lot of implications, including for your morning commute.\nTraffic-choked monster\nThe Capital Beltway that encircles Washington and its near suburbs is more than just a metaphor for the alleged insularity of the people who live within it. It is often a traffic-choked monster that ruins the commutes of many who must use it.\nBut for a 14-mile stretch, there is an out if you have the money. A parallel toll road allows those willing to pay — 20 cents a mile during slow periods, $1 a mile during a typical rush hour, more during times of extreme traffic — to ensure it is never clogged.\nThe toll road, a joint venture between Virginia’s transportation department and the Australian company Transurban, is an example of dynamic pricing as a tool to reduce traffic. Different in approach — but with the same ultimate goal — is congestion pricing, a fee on cars and trucks to enter a dense urban area. Congestion pricing has gone into effect in Stockholm and London but was rejected for New York in 2008 (Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York has indicated new openness to the idea this year).\nIn these areas, there is too much demand for space on the roads and too little supply of road, and each of these strategies tries to use pricing to bring supply and demand into balance. But paying variable prices for a good that has previously been free (most roads) or charged at some fixed rate (traditional toll roads) raises all sorts of issues.\nThis new approach to modulating traffic may become more acceptable to voters when it is part of an increase in supply.\nIf variable tolls or congestion charges are merely about pricing some people out of the market and letting rich people avoid the nuisance of traffic, they probably won’t go over so well. But if they are part of creating more supply of road, ensuring more people over all can get where they want to go — and if people are frequently reminded of that — the measures may go down easier.\nThe Transurban deal with Virginia essentially makes private money available for additional road capacity — the express lanes on the Capital Beltway were built from scratch. Its existence also serves to reduce the traffic on the traditional lanes.\nGovernor Cuomo has pitched a New York congestion fee as a funding stream to improve and expand New York’s rail system. If that happens, it could mean more capacity to get people in and out of the city.\nAnother lesson from these pricing experiments is that they tend to be most resisted when they are new. When Stockholm experimented with a charge to enter the city center in 2006, it was highly controversial, with people in suburban towns especially viewing it as an unfair tax.\nBut since being made permanent in 2007, opinion has shifted, said Maria Borjesson, a transportation economist at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.\n“I think an important lesson is that the conception of what is fair changes,” she said. “Before the charge, the discussion was of how unfair it was and how it would be hardest for low-income people. Now when we do surveys, we find that people think it is unfair if the people who use the streets and pollute and increase congestion don’t pay. We’ve seen this everywhere that has implemented congestion charges, that public support increases afterward.”\nA lesson for Uber, and all us\nPeople’s perceptions of what is fair and just are not set in stone; they evolve over time. But companies looking to use variable pricing have to be cognizant of how important it is to respect those perceptions.\nUber has often been cast as the embodiment of excessive use of surge pricing. For example, in 2013, Jessica Seinfeld, the cookbook author and wife of the comedian Jerry Seinfeld, was outraged to face a $415 charge for a short ride in a snowstorm, and told her Instagram followers all about it. Since then, Uber has taken a range of actions to try to keep the benefits of variable pricing while reducing the outrage.\nIt has adopted a quicker trigger finger for eliminating surge pricing entirely in emergency situations, for one thing. When Mexico City had a major earthquake on Sept. 19, an operations worker at the company’s local headquarters turned off surge pricing, even while the building was still shaking.\n“The fact that one of our teammates had the presence of mind to turn off surge in that chaotic moment, I think, reflects the deep responsibility we all feel toward our fellow citizens and the cities we serve,” said Rodrigo Arévalo, general manager for Uber in Latin America.\nThe company also cut back on passenger complaints by giving a clear estimate of the price of a ride before a person books a car, a practice that began last year. It turns out it’s easier to decide whether it’s worth $30 for a car ride and act accordingly than it is to be told that a surge multiplier of 2.5 times is in place and that the normal rate would probably come to about $12.\nRestaurants have long known that charging a fee for a reservation offends people’s sensibilities — but that on a big night like New Year’s Eve you can require everyone to eat an expensive fixed-price menu with lobster and filet. Diners will happily pay a surge price without thinking of it as such.\n\nWhat the successful examples of variable pricing have in common is that they treat customers’ desire for fairness not as some irrational rejection of economic logic to be scoffed at, but something fundamental, hard-wired into their view of the world. It is a reality that has to be respected and understood, whether you’re setting the price for a highway toll, a kilowatt of power on a hot day, or a generator after a hurricane.\n“If you treat people in a way they think is unfair, then it will come back and bite you,” Mr. Thaler said. And it doesn’t take a Nobel to understand that.\n', '/images/5.gif');

European regulators, knee deep in a campaign to stamp out tax avoidance, have their own plans for that money.\nLast week, for instance, the European Commission billed Amazon for $293 million in unpaid taxes in Luxembourg, arguing that the country’s failure to collect the tax amounted to an illegal state subsidy. It also took Ireland to court for not following up on the $15.2 billion tax bill imposed on Apple last year.\n“The Europeans are targeting U.S. dollars overseas that the U.S. believes should be taxed here,” said Dave Camp, a former Republican representative from Michigan who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the author of an unsuccessful tax overhaulin 2014. “We have to address this problem before the Europeans get there first.”\nThe rulings on Amazon and Apple — which those companies are disputing — are byproducts of a race among governments to lure corporate giants to their shores in the hunt for new sources of revenue. That cutthroat competition is the reason that 73 percent of Fortune 500 companies have a subsidiary in a low-tax haven, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.\nThat rivalry has the potential to fuel tensions between the United States and its allies. Yet it could turn out that the European crackdown on American multinationals will ultimately help — rather than hobble — Washington’s efforts to get them to pay up. The harder that other countries make it for American companies to take advantage of tax havens and sweetheart deals abroad, the weaker the incentives are for businesses to stash money out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.\nRepublican leaders have already put at the center of their tax rewrite an idea borrowed from Europe and other countries: Replace the system of taxing the worldwide profits of a domestic corporation with one that taxes only profits earned within its own territory.\n“If we don’t move to a more modern system, we may lose the ability to gain that revenue,” Mr. Camp warned.\nMultinationals will inevitably shop around for low rates. Americans and foreign companies have all played the same games, shifting patents and copyrights, profits and royalties to places with no or low corporate tax rates, like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. (The I.R.S. itself went after Amazon over assets it transferred to a Luxembourg unit, but Amazon ultimately prevailed.)\nEfforts to cooperate have not always been successful, but there are signs that coordination can help. The Europeans’ effort is gradually shutting down the most notorious tax dodges that route corporate cash through Ireland and Luxembourg, said Michael J. Graetz, a professor and tax specialist at Columbia Law School.\n“Those are like dinosaurs,” he said. “They’re moving towards extinction.”\nAnd a new rule adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, requiring multinationals to report their income and tax bill in each country, will make it easier for the more than 60 governments that have signed on to monitor how much is actually collected.\nSo far, the team of Trump administration officials and lawmakers who drew up the latest framework for rewriting the tax code has released mostly general principles.\nNow the I.R.S. taxes the worldwide profits of American corporations, but the tax kicks in only after that income is repatriated to the United States. As a result, American multinationals simply don’t bring much of it home. Republicans have made clear they intend to switch to taxing only profits earned within the United States, what’s known as a territorial system. OPEN GRAPHIC \nThe $2.6 trillion in foreign profits that corporations already parked overseas in order to escape paying the I.R.S. would be required to be repatriated — although taxed at a steep discount. And there are promises to prevent the tax base from shrinking, and discourage businesses from putting more operations and earnings overseas. At the same time, the official corporate rate would be slashed to 20 percent, from 35 percent, to make American companies more competitive with their foreign rivals.\nBut this frame still lacks a picture, missing the details of how to accomplish those ambitious if sometimes conflicting goals.\nWithout tough safeguards, for example, the shift away from a worldwide system could end up curbing rather than promoting investment at home as American companies move even more operations overseas to avoid paying any United States taxes.\nTo some experts, like Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College, the only way to prevent American companies from exploiting loopholes in a new territorial regime is with a minimum tax. If a company’s tax rate fell below the floor in, say, Bermuda, it would have to pay the difference to the I.R.S.\nOther experts, though, suggest borrowing another idea to broaden the tax base from foreign tax regulators — like more aggressive efforts to tax foreign multinationals.\nAs the Amazon and Apple cases show, “the politics in Europe are to tax somebody else’s multinationals, particularly ours,” said Mr. Graetz of Columbia.\n“All of these other countries are basically trying to beef up and protect their tax base by ensuring foreign multinationals pay tax on income earned in their country,” he added, “and not on income earned by their own domestic multinationals.”\nThis is a different tack from the one taken in the United States, where tax dodges by homegrown billion-dollar corporations have been criticized for increasing the tax burden on companies that can’t shield assets.\nThe complaint that the American tax code favors foreign multinationals over domestic ones did, however, arouse interest last week at Senate hearings on a tax overhaul.\n“The United States corporate and international tax rules are an anticompetitive mess,” said Itai Grinberg, a law professor at Georgetown University. And one of their most senseless features, he added, is the tax advantage that permits foreign-owned corporations to artificially strip out their earnings in the United States.\nBoth he and Bret Wells, a law professor at the University of Houston, testified that foreign and American companies should be treated the same way.\nLeveling the playing field does not necessarily have to wait for a rewritten tax code. Adam Looney, a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis at the Treasury Department, said the Trump administration could take a step now. He urged the president to reverse a decision to delay an Obama-era regulation to limit foreign companies’ tax advantages and prevent them from transferring out their earnings.\n“Without the regulations, American-owned businesses will be worse off,” while foreign multinationals avoid about $7.4 billion in United States taxes, Mr. Looney wrote this week in a policy brief for the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.\nThe delay, he said, means that the United States is, in effect, paying “foreign investors to take over our companies with our own tax dollars.”\n\n', '/images/6.jpg');
INSERT INTO `news` VALUES (7, 3, 'Trump Disavows Nuclear Deal, but Doesn’t Scrap It', 'MARK LANDLER and DAVID E. SANGER', 1507870800, 'WASHINGTON — President Trump announced on Friday his decision to disavow the Iran nuclear agreement, threatening to leave the deal altogether if it was not amended to permanently block Tehran from building nuclear weapons or intercontinental missiles. But even as he delivered a fire-breathing indictment of the Iranian government’s activities around the Middle East, he stopped short of unraveling the agreement reached by President Barack Obama two years ago. “We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more chaos, the very real threat of Iran’s nuclear breakout,” Mr. Trump declared at the White House in a speech that was intended to define a broad strategy for confronting Iran. Mr. Trump’s decision not to certify that Iran was complying with all terms of the agreement came after a fierce debate inside the administration, according to a senior official familiar with the discussions and who agreed to describe them on the condition of anonymity. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis argued that it was in the national security interests of the United States to keep the deal’s constraints on Iran. The two men succeeded, over time, in persuading Mr. Trump not to immediately scrap the accord, despite his campaign promise to do so. Mr. Trump, in declaring his intention not to certify Iran’s compliance with the deal, essentially kicked to Congress a decision about whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran and blow up the agreement. His aides, however, insisted that was not the goal, and that they instead wanted Congress to enact legislation defining what would incite the United States to reimpose sanctions. The president listed three such triggers — the deployment of an intercontinental ballistic missile by Iran, Iran’s refusal to negotiate an extension of the deal’s existing constraint on its nuclear activities and evidence that Iran could manufacture a bomb in less than 12 months. Any of those could prompt the United States to walk away from the deal. “In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies,” he said, “then the agreement will be terminated.” Persuading the allies to renegotiate the deal is a far-fetched goal. The leaders of Britain, France and Germany quickly issued a joint statement urging the United States to adhere to the agreement, which they hailed as “the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy.” Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said his country would consider “no amendment whatsoever” to the deal. And enacting new legislation on Iran would require 60 votes in the Senate, meaning Republicans would need to pick up the support of at least eight Democrats. Senate Democrats had urged Mr. Trump not to withhold certification, and they are unlikely to agree to legislation without assurances that the deal will remain intact. Mr. Trump’s scalding critique of the nuclear deal as “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into” echoed the language he used during his presidential campaign. But he also acknowledged the obstacles to ripping it up. “What’s done is done,” Mr. Trump said, “and that’s why we are where we are.” The president seemed determined to erase any residual hope that the nuclear deal might form the basis of a new relationship between the United States and Iran. His speech, from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, was perhaps the most hostile of any American leader toward Iran since President George W. Bush placed the country on his “axis of evil” in 2002. Mr. Trump recited a litany of misdeeds by Iran going back to the 1979 hostage crisis and described it as the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, supporting Al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah and the Taliban. He also accused the country of dealing with North Korea, a reference to Pyongyang’s long history of selling missile technology to Iran, and said he had asked the nation’s intelligence agencies to investigate whether the relationship went further. His tone made clear that Mr. Trump has no interest in what, for the Obama administration, was the biggest gamble of the accord: to provide the basis for two longtime adversaries to find other ways to cooperate. He also suggested that Iran would never change. “Given the regime’s murderous past and present, we should not take lightly its sinister vision for the future,” the president said. “The regime’s two favorite chants are ‘Death to America’ and ‘Death to Israel.’” The nuclear deal is the latest international agreement that Mr. Trump has tried to exit, amend or water down, including the Paris climate accord and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The closest analogy to this deal may be Nafta, the trade agreement that Mr. Trump once threatened to rip up and is now undergoing a painstaking renegotiation. Critics said Mr. Trump risked isolating the United States diplomatically and giving up the deal’s hard-won gains, including intrusive inspections of Iran’s nuclear facilities. The angriest voice belonged to former Secretary of State John Kerry, who spent several years negotiating the accord that Mr. Trump denounced. “It is very, very poor, nonstrategic diplomacy,” Mr. Kerry said in an interview, his voice rising. Pointing out that “you cannot unilaterally reset the terms of the deal,” he said the agreement “gives us a quarter-century of absolute accountability” and assured that “the minute we see the stockpile going up, the questions and red flags will go up like crazy. And 15 or 25 years from now, we still have the same military options we have today.” “If you want to have your war, Donald Trump,” Mr. Kerry said, “you can have it in 20 years.” Congress is deeply divided on the Iran deal, and getting it to agree on additional legislation could prove difficult. While some Republicans are eager to undermine the deal, Democrats are equally determined to preserve what they view as another legacy of the Obama administration that Mr. Trump is trying to dismantle. “We will not buy into the false premise that it is Congress’s role to legislate solutions to problems of his own making,” said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the committee, released a potential blueprint for imposing an automatic return of sanctions if Iran was believed to be capable of producing a nuclear weapon within a year, or if it violated other restrictions. He worked on the proposal with White House officials and Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican who is a hard-liner on Iran, and predicted it could win bipartisan support. It suggests that Mr. Corker’s bitter personal feud with Mr. Trump will not obstruct cooperation on this issue. Mr. Corker, acknowledging he had little choice but to “deal the circumstances as they are,” signaled that he would work to try to find points of compromise — possibly including assurance that the deal would not simply be ripped up by the president. “You’re going to see all of this evolve in daylight,” he told reporters. Decertification does not, by itself, affect the American obligation to adhere to the deal, including the lifting of some economic sanctions. Since becoming president, Mr. Trump has twice reluctantly certified the agreement. But administration officials concluded that he could not bring himself to do that every 90 days, even if the judgment of nuclear inspectors and his own intelligence agencies was that Iran was in compliance. So they tried to find a solution that would allow Mr. Trump to signal his disapproval of the deal without putting the United States in the position of being the first signatory to violate it. That solution was to declare that the suspension of sanctions was not “appropriate and proportionate” to the steps that Iran has taken to end its illicit nuclear activities. That formulation is narrower than declaring that the agreement is no longer in the nation’s national security interests, and administration officials said it was chosen carefully to avoid putting Mr. Trump in a box the next time he had to decide whether to waive sanctions against Iran. While Mr. Trump’s speech was described beforehand by his aides as a description of a broad new initiative to push back on Iran, he gave little description of what that would be. Mr. Trump did say the United States would increase pressure on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which he described as the “supreme leader’s corrupt personal terror force and militia.” The Treasury Department announced it would designate the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group, expanding an existing designation of the Quds Force, the corps’ paramilitary wing. But Mr. Trump stopped short of putting it on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations. Such a designation, Mr. Tillerson said, would impede military operations in which American and Iranian forces found themselves on the same battlefield — presumably fighting the Islamic State.

INSERT INTO `news` VALUES (8, 3, 'End to Health Care Subsidies Puts Congress in a Tight Spot', 'THOMAS KAPLAN ', 1507870800, 'WASHINGTON — President Trump’s decision to cut off critical payments to health insurance companies ratcheted up the pressure on Congress on Friday to take action to protect consumers from soaring premiums, while also adding a combustible new issue to negotiations to avert a government shutdown this year.\nMr. Trump’s move, announced Thursday night, could cause chaos in insurance markets, sending insurers fleeing from the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces, raising the federal government’s costs and pricing out some consumers. It came just hours after he signed an executive order that also undermined the health law by encouraging the development of lower-cost insurance policies not subject to the Affordable Care Act’s rigorous coverage standards.\nBut the president suggested on Friday that he was trying to get Democrats to the negotiating table.\n“If the Democrats were smart, what they’d do is come and negotiate something where people could really get the kind of health care that they deserve,” Mr. Trump told reporters, insisting that the subsidies were “making insurance companies rich.”\nHe kept up the drumbeat on Friday night, writing on Twitter:\nThe subsidies, known as cost-sharing reduction payments, go to insurance companies to offset the cost of reducing out-of-pocket expenses like deductibles and copayments for low-income customers. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers will still have to help those customers, but without the help of Washington, they say, they will increase premiums. And with their profits squeezed, they could abandon the marketplaces.\nEven before Mr. Trump’s decision, Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, were working on legislation to extend the subsidies, paired with other measures to offer states more flexibility regulating health plans offered under President Barack Obama’s health law.\n    But Republicans in Congress are divided. Some worry that ending the subsidies would hurt their constituents. Others are loath to do anything that could be seen as propping up the health law that they had promised to tear down.\nFor their part, Democrats are convinced that any blame for rising premiums and shrinking choices will fall on Republicans, who now control the White House and Congress. After spending the year trying to preserve the Affordable Care Act, Democrats did not appear ready on Friday to make major concessions.\n“Unless our Republican colleagues act, the American people will know exactly where to place the blame when their premiums shoot up and when millions lose coverage,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. OPEN GRAPHIC \nThe uncertainty over the payments to insurers has loomed over Congress for months, but Mr. Trump’s action is forcing lawmakers to confront the issue head on less than three weeks before the start of the annual open enrollment season under the Affordable Care Act.\nEven with the president’s move, it was far from clear whether lawmakers could agree on steps to continue the payments. The negotiations between Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray had stalled over how much latitude to give states seeking waivers from requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\nStill, Ms. Murray expressed optimism and called on Republican leaders to support the efforts.\nAbout seven million people benefit from the cost-sharing subsidies. The president’s decision, by destabilizing insurance markets and driving up premiums, could adversely affect millions of others who buy insurance on their own and do not receive federal subsidies, health policy experts said.\nRepresentative Tom Reed, Republican of New York and co-chairman of a bipartisan group of lawmakers called the Problem Solvers Caucus, said Mr. Trump’s decision “increased the stakes” for Congress. More than two months ago, Mr. Reed’s group offered a series of proposals to shore up insurance markets, including funding the subsidies.\n“It’s only going to get worse as this marketplace continues to destabilize,” Mr. Reed said. “If we stay where we are and do nothing, I think this is going to be a pox on all of our houses.”\nRepresentative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he had been in discussions with other Republicans over proposals to drive down premiums that could be tied to a continuation of the subsidies for insurers.\n“The fundamental question is, what do you get in terms of relief for insurance premiums and health care costs, broadly, in exchange for continuing a bailout to the insurance companies in the short run or long run?” Mr. Meadows said.\nAs lawmakers mulled how to move forward, doctors, hospitals, insurers, state insurance commissioners and advocates for patients denounced Mr. Trump’s decision.\n“Our patients will ultimately pay the price,” said Dr. David O. Barbe, the president of the American Medical Association. “We urge Congress to accelerate its efforts to reinstate these payments before further damage is done.”\nGovernors also weighed in, expressing alarm at the termination of the subsidies. “We are deeply concerned that the administration has declined to continue these payments, further increasing uncertainty for state marketplaces,” the National Governors Association said.\nGov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, a Republican, told The Nevada Independent that the president’s decision was “going to hurt kids.” He continued: “It’s going to hurt families. It’s going to hurt individuals. It’s going to hurt people with mental health issues. It’s going to hurt veterans. It’s going to hurt everybody.”\nThe attorneys general of 18 states, including California, Massachusetts and New York, filed suit on Friday to prevent any interruption in the payments.\nBut the Trump administration insisted that a federal district judge was right in ruling last year that the payments were unconstitutional because Congress never explicitly provided money for them.\n“Congress has the power of the purse, and it is up to Congress to decide which programs it will and will not fund,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a legal opinion, adding: “The executive branch cannot unilaterally spend money that Congress has not appropriated.”\nThe cost-sharing subsidies are available to people with incomes of 100 percent to 250 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $12,060 to $30,150 a year for an individual.\n“Cost sharing reductions are critical to low income Americans,” Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, wrote on Twitter. “Congress should guarantee their funding through the appropriations process.”\nIn fact, the consequences of the president’s action would ripple through the individual market. The premium increases would be felt most by middle-class consumers who do not qualify for federal aid with either their premiums or their out-of-pocket costs.\nThe government’s costs are also likely to rise, since subsidies to purchase insurance through the marketplaces increase as premiums rise. The Congressional Budget Office said in August that if the cost-sharing subsidies were cut off, premiums would shoot up 20 percent next year, and federal budget deficits would increase by $194 billion in the coming decade.\nYet conservative Republicans made clear they have no appetite for providing billions of dollars to insurers.\n“Under no circumstance should Congress attempt to expand Obamacare by cutting a check for President Obama’s bailout of insurance companies,” said Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee.\nRepresentative Dave Brat, a conservative Republican from Virginia, said Mr. Trump was simply correcting a “constitutional error” made by the Obama administration.\nMr. Brat said he did not want to provide money for the subsidies because they would just “prop up a failing system in which the government coerces people to buy gold-plated insurance policies that no one can afford.”\nThe showdown increased tensions over a fiscal deadline facing lawmakers. Mr. Trump and Democrats struck a deal in September that included a stopgap spending measure to keep the government funded through Dec. 8.\nNow, the fate of the cost-sharing reduction payments could wind up intertwined in the negotiations over a spending measure to avert a government shutdown. Already, the contentious issue of immigration could become part of those spending talks, as Democrats are determined, in the coming months, to secure protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.\nMr. Schumer said the coming spending measure offered a “very good opportunity” to secure money for the subsidies.\n', '/images/8.jpg');
INSERT INTO `news` VALUES (9, 3, 'Black Lawmakers Hold a Particular Grievance With Facebook: Racial Exploitation ', 'YAMICHE ALCINDOR ', 1507870800, 'WASHINGTON — For more than an hour, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s high-profile chief operating officer, sheepishly pledged to “do better” — over and over — as stern-faced members of the Congressional Black Caucus grilled her on Thursday about Russian ads aimed at exploiting racial divisions during last year’s election. For black lawmakers, it was a chance to vent — at the outrage they felt toward Russian intelligence and its efforts to foment racial unrest in the country; at the frustration they felt toward three separate congressional investigations into Russian interference that have plodded on and yielded little; and at Facebook itself, which has been long on promises and short on action. “She was checking the boxes. She said all the right things,” Representative Donald M. Payne Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said of Ms. Sandberg. But he was not satisfied. “I had an uncle who hated when you said ‘gonna’: ‘I’m gonna do this, and I’m gonna do that.’ He used to say, ‘Don’t be a gonna.’ And that’s what I said to her, ‘Don’t be a gonna.’” Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, after initially denying that Russians had exploited the company’s system, has reversed course and admitted that groups backed by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia paid Facebook to influence voters last year with ads designed to inflame and exploit racial, political and economic rifts in the United States. Russian-backed Facebook pages promoted anti-immigrant rallies, targeted the Black Lives Matter movement and focused attentions on critical election swing states like Wisconsin and Michigan. While Facebook has yet to release any of the ads, it has hired three crisis communications firms, bought digital and newspaper ads and sent Ms. Sandberg to Washington last week to charm Congress and the public. But the grievance of black lawmakers is a particular one: As black activists tried last year to focus attention on police brutality, unfair treatment before the law, inequality and white supremacy, social media giants like Facebook were being commandeered by Russian intelligence agents to turn white voters against them. For Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, the moment recalled the 1970s, when another government, this one in Washington, not Moscow, targeted black activists. She served as a community worker for the Black Panther Party as the F.B.I. used false information to go after its members. “That actually got people killed and destroyed organizations,” Ms. Lee said. “Now look at Facebook allowing ads by the Russian government to create this kind of environment. That’s a problem. I don’t know if they’re even aware of the history and how dangerous allowing the promotion of division and racial animosity and racial hatred can be.” And nearly a year after the election, black lawmakers say, little is being done to reverse the damage. Russia studied and exploited the “fault lines of racial tension,” said Representative Yvette D. Clarke, Democrat of New York, and multiple investigations into Russia’s actions and the Trump’s campaign possible involvement have thus far offered no safeguards to stop Moscow’s efforts. “Things are moving far too slow because we should be putting protective measures in place,” Ms. Clarke said. “We need to step up to the challenge.” During the meeting, Ms. Sandberg frequently said she agreed as more than a dozen members of the Congressional Black Caucus demanded action from the company. Several people in the meeting said Ms. Sandberg frequently said, “We will do better” and “You will get answers.” But her answers fueled the anger of some black lawmakers who said for years that they have been pushing Facebook to add a black person to its all-white board of directors and to diversify its staff. Several members have also written letters to Facebook and other companies demanding answers related to the presidential election. On Thursday, the company’s chief diversity officer, Maxine Williams, said in the meeting that Facebook had recently hired a record number of minority employees, and Ms. Sandberg promised that the company planned to add a black person to its board. The issue of Russia exploiting already charged race relations in the United States hits especially home for many members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, Democrat of Missouri, who explained to Ms. Sandberg on Thursday that a man had attempted to bomb his office in 2014 in Kansas City based on false information and conspiracy theories. Mr. Cleaver, a cousin of Eldridge Cleaver, an early leader of the Black Panthers, said after the meeting that he was constantly on guard because many detractors falsely believe that his family member killed police officers. “People get all worked up on the internet and do crazy things, and some of us are the recipients of their insanity,” Mr. Cleaver said. “It feels like the whole country is changing, and we’re having a national nervous breakdown.” For others, the anger is more with Moscow than Silicon Valley. Already, they say, the United States has to deal with the remnants of slavery, institutional racism in schools and the criminal justice system, and now a foreign adversary is stirring a boiling pot. Shortly after the meeting with Ms. Sandberg, Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he was concerned that the F.B.I. may have bought into Russia’s exploitation of African-Americans with its new class of threats called “Black Identity Extremists.” Mr. Richmond said that he feared that the F.B.I. may now go after black people who protest unfair policing practices and discriminatory policies based on false information peddled on social media. “This is a very fragile moment in time for African-Americans across this country,” Mr. Richmond said. “What we needed Facebook to understand is that they play a role in the perception of African-Americans.” Representative Robin Kelly, a Democrat of Illinois, said she often hears from constituents who want to know why the investigations have taken so long. Ms. Kelly is also the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee’s Subcommittee on Information Technology and sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats. Neither panel has had a hearing on Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election, she said. “I don’t know the intelligence process, and I’m sure they want to be thorough and all of that,” she said. But, she added, “people are anxious.” At least some members of the caucus have started thinking about what ways Congress may have to step in and shield Americans from Russia’s influence. Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrat of New Jersey, said lawmakers may need to come up with new ways to combat false information and fight back against Russia. That might mean Facebook would face new regulations. “Our concerns will not get ignored,” Ms. Watson Coleman said. “It’s either you clean up your act, or government will have to act in that space.” ', '/images/9.jpg');

The roster of on-the-record quotes included actress Ashley Judd and Mark Gill, an executive who had formerly run Weinstein\'s Miramax Films. \nWeinstein responded with a strategically confusing statement that expressed contrition, while he simultaneously criticized the paper and threatened legal action. \nA spokeswoman for Weinstein told CNN this week that \"any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied.\" In his original statement, Weinstein apologized for \"the way I\'ve behaved with colleagues in the past,\" and stated that he needs to \"conquer my demons.\" \nBloom, best known for representing women in similar matters, also came under fire for participating in Weinstein\'s defense, She subsequently resigned shortly after the story broke. \nCriticism began almost immediately, mostly from conservative media voices, about Democratic politicians -- who accepted money from Weinstein, a major donor -- not distancing themselves or criticizing him. Related charges were leveled at late-night comics who had lampooned famous conservative figures accused of harassment, including Roger Ailes and Bill O\'Reilly. \nAfter being noticeably quiet to start, late-night comics seemed to rally. There was a flurry of coverage and new accusers and virtually all the late-night hosts began to tell Weinstein jokes. And politicians, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, have since condemned the alleged behavior. \nThe New Yorker delivers a second blow\nThe New Yorker published its story on Oct. 10, with even more explosive accusations, with three women accusing Weinstein of raping them. Moreover, the piece included audiotape of a sting operation in which Weinstein was recorded seemingly seeking to coerce a model, Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, into acceding to his demands, at one point telling her, \"Don\'t ruin your friendship with me for five minutes.\" \nWritten by Ronan Farrow, the release of the article also turned attention to NBC News, which had passed on an opportunity to air a TV piece or, barring that, post the story on its website. An NBC contributor, Farrow referred questions regarding how the story slipped away to the network, with NBC News president Noah Oppenheim saying that those responsible \"didn\'t feel that we had all the elements that we needed to air.\" \nHollywood\'s reckoning\nActress Rose McGowan added her voice to those who have accused Weinstein of rape, identifying him -- with his initials in a tweet -- as the executive she referred to last year only anonymously. She also produced a backlash against Twitter, which temporarily suspended her account. (The explanation was that she violated its terms of service by posting a private phone number, but that didn\'t quell outrage charging hypocrisy on Twitter\'s part.) \nRelated: Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal grows as more women come forward\nAfter Ben Affleck expressed that he was \"saddened and angry\" by the story, video was resurfaced of the actor groping Hilarie Burton during a 2003 appearance on MTV\'s \"Total Request Live.\" He subsequently apologized.\nOthers have been forced to apologize or walk back comments defending or expressing sympathy for Weinstein, including Lindsay Lohan, designer Donna Karan, and director Oliver Stone. \nCompany under siege \nOn a corporate level, the future of the Weinstein Co. is now in doubt, with questions still swirling as to what board members might have known, or should have, regarding his actions. In a statement, the board denied knowing about any abuse, or confidential payments to abuse victims, and on Friday, Weinstein\'s brother Bob, the company\'s CEO, issued a statement saying there are no plans to sell the company, insisting \"business is continuing as usual.\" \nRelated: Can the company Harvey Weinstein founded survive his scandal?\nSeveral high-profile actresses, such as Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, have shared their own stories and accusations of being sexually harassed by Weinstein. \nThose who have worked closely with Weinstein are now being asked about what they knew, or had heard -- a question seems likely to come up on red carpets and at other public events for some time to come. \nAmid the fast-moving fallout, executives and talent are seeking to extricate themselves from existing and pending deals with the Weinstein Co. \nWeinstein also faces potential legal jeopardy, with authorities in New York and London saying that they are investigating allegations of sexual assault involving him. \nSteps to professionally shun Weinstein will likely continue this weekend, as both the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Producers Guild of America will weigh in on his status with those organizations on Saturday. The academy\'s British counterpart, commonly known as BAFTA, has already suspended his membership.\nOn Friday, meanwhile, Roy Price took a leave of absence from Amazon Studios, where he oversees programming efforts, after accusations surfaced that in 2015, he had sexually harassed a producer on one of the service\'s series, \"The Man in the High Castle.\" Price has not commented. \nBy the end of the week, perceptions were growing that there will be other shoes to drop as more women in Hollywood decide to speak out.\n', '/images/10.jpg');

The moves he has taken risk blowing up the individual markets by making insurance too expensive for lower- and middle-class families. Trump\'s actions, however, could backfire politically, threatening to shift blame for the health care act\'s shortcomings from former President Barack Obama and Democrats to Trump and Republicans.\nThat is something Republicans have feared and now believe will happen.\n', '/images/13.jpg');

But over the past couple of weeks she became a victim herself, and began to see things from a different perspective. She hasn\'t really slept in days.\nFlores, who works as a flight attendant, was in Las Vegas on October 1, watching Jason Aldean perform at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when a gunman, perched in a suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay, opened fire on the crowd, killing 58 and wounding hundreds.\nDays later, after returning home to Santa Rosa, California, she and her parents were forced to flee their home and escape the wildfires that have devastated Northern California. The rental house is gone, along with all her parents\' belongings, Flores told CNN.\n\"It\'s just a very helpless feeling,\" she said of the past couple of weeks. \"I just thought, well, I\'ve been in these situations before. It shouldn\'t be a big deal.\n\"But when it\'s happening to you, it\'s a whole different realm.\"\n\nLas Vegas: \'It drove me nuts\'\nFlores had flown into Las Vegas on Sunday morning and was waiting for her next trip, Monday night, to Boston. She was staying at the Hooters Hotel, she said, because they offered discounted rates to airline crews. The building is blocks away from the Mandalay Bay and the Las Vegas Village, the site of the festival that unwittingly played host to the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.\n\"I\'m a huge country fan,\" Flores said, so she decided to head down to the festival to listen to Jason Aldean from outside the fence along Las Vegas Boulevard since she was without a ticket.\nAs she was listening, she heard the first gunshots, but said she wasn\'t paying much attention. It wasn\'t until after the gunfire resumed after a short break that she realized that what she was hearing.\n\"That\'s when everybody started screaming and coming out of the festival screaming, \'Shooter!\'\" Flores said. \"I ran down Las Vegas Boulevard.\"\nShe managed to hide in a nearby casino\'s conference room with other concertgoers. Flores waited there for hours, her only updates coming from a coworker who was listening to a police scanner.\n\"It drove me nuts,\" Flores said of hiding in the room. \"You\'re sitting there waiting for someone to open the door and be shot.\"\nWhen she finally was able to leave, she went back to her hotel room and tried to sleep, she said, \"which did not happen.\"\nShe looked out her hotel room window, toward the site of the festival.\n\"That night, I could see the bodies,\" she said.\nBut Flores, who has multiple jobs, worked for the next four days.\n\n', '/images/14.jpg');

The 26-year-old will be eligible to return when the Blazers clash with the Indiana Pacers at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Friday. \nWith McCollum out of the picture, Blazers head coach Terry Stotts will need to lean on Evan Turner, Maurice Harkless, Pat Connaughton and perhaps Shabazz Napier to fill the void on the wing. \nMcCollum averaged a career-high 23.0 points per game on 48.0 percent shooting from the field, 42.1 percent from three and a league-best 91.2 percent shooting from the free-throw line last season.\n\n', '/images/15.jpg');

Per Bill Shaikin of the Los Angeles Times, Seager is not on the Dodgers\' 25-man roster for the NLCS due to a back injury.  Shaikin added that Joc Pederson has been put on the Dodgers\' NLCS roster in the event Chris Taylor and/or Enrique Hernandez need to play shortstop.  Joshua Thornton of MLB.com noted Seager has been held out of team workouts the previous two days due to a muscular issue in his back. Andy McCullough of the Los Angeles Times reported Seager injured his back in Game 3 of the National League Division Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks.  Following up on his Rookie of the Year-winning campaign a year ago, Seager continues to be one of MLB\'s best shortstops. The 23-year-old hit .295/.375/.479 in 145 games during the 2017 regular season.  On almost any other team, losing Seager would be a big blow to the lineup. Not only does he boast power, he helps set the table with his ability to draw walks and get on base. The Dodgers, on the other hand, have no shortage of offensive firepower, even without Seager. Cody Bellinger is the runaway favorite for National League Rookie of the Year, while Yasiel Puig and Justin Turner also help make up the heart of the order. Los Angeles even acquired Curtis Granderson in August to further solidify the offense. If Taylor ends up as Seager\'s replacement at shortstop, he\'s not a bad fallback. He hit .288/.354/.496 during the regular season and played five different positions for Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.  ', '/images/16.jpg');

The Greek Freak I think is a force, and I\'ve never seen anything like him. And his ceiling is probably—he could end up being the best player to ever play if he really wanted to. That\'s pretty scary to think about. But he\'s by far my favorite player to watch.\"  \nDurant\'s comments can be heard in full beginning at the 9:57 mark: \nBack in June, Durant congratulated Antetokounmpo on his 2016-17 Most Improved Player award and predicted more big things in the 22-year-old\'s future. \n\"Congrats on MIP, this dude is a specimen that we\'ve never seen before and it\'s guaranteed that he will be an MVP one day!\" Durant wrote. \"In fact, I called out this years MVP years ago so you gotta respect my knowledge for the game lol.\"\nA few months earlier, Durant appeared on The Bill Simmons Podcast (h/t NBA.com) and said he thought Antetokounmpo was more physically imposing than him:\n\"Look at Giannis. Giannis Antetokounmpo, this guy is scary. He\'s more athletic than I am. He\'s longer than me. He\'s faster. He\'s going to be stronger than I am.\n\"... A lot of people told me he looked up to me, and I didn\'t know that, but a lot of people said that. We played in Milwaukee one time and I was working out before the game and I just saw him staring at me, just watching me the whole time. I was like it feels good that I can influence a young guy like that.\"\nDurant was on to something. \nIn just his fourth NBA season, Antetokounmpo took the NBA by storm and became the first player since Kevin Garnett (2002-03) to average at least 20 points, eight rebounds, five assists and 1.5 blocks per game. \nNow headed for his fifth professional campaign, Antetokounmpo will attempt to propel the Bucks past the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2001.  \nMilwaukee opens the 2017-18 regular season next Wednesday against the Boston Celtics at TD Garden.\n\n', '/images/17.jpg');
